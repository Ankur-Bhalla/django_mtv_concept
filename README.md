# django_mtv_concept

# Example of MTV pattern - (Model, Template, View pattern)
# The table or page will be an HTML table of all the webpage and access date of webpage records
# from the AccessRecord database we created and populated. We will use template tagging to connect
# the model to the html page i.e, we will use template tags to generate this content from the
# AccessRecord model.

# Also connect to Mysql (pip install mysqlclient) server. For this created mtv_app\router.py file and
# did changes under settings.py file (for DATABASE_ROUTERS and DATABASES).
